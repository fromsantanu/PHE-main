## Chapter: Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases

### 1. Introduction

Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases pose significant challenges to global public health. These diseases can lead to widespread morbidity and mortality, disrupt economies, and strain healthcare systems. Emerging infectious diseases are those that have recently appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. Re-emerging infectious diseases are those that were once under control but are now reappearing or increasing in incidence. This chapter explores the causes, impacts, and strategies for managing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

### 2. Overview of Emerging Infectious Diseases

#### 2.1. Zoonotic Diseases

**Definition:**  
Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans. The majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, often originating from wildlife.

**Examples:**
- **Ebola Virus Disease (EVD):** Transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats or primates, and then spread through human-to-human transmission.
- **Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS):** Caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus, with camels as the primary animal reservoir.
- **Nipah Virus:** Transmitted from fruit bats to humans, often through contaminated food or direct contact with infected animals.

**Key Drivers:**
- **Human-Wildlife Interaction:** Increasing contact between humans and wildlife due to deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion.
- **Globalization and Trade:** The global trade of animals and animal products increases the risk of zoonotic disease spread.

#### 2.2. Vector-Borne Diseases

**Definition:**  
Vector-borne diseases are transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas. These diseases are influenced by environmental factors and are often associated with changing climates and ecosystems.

**Examples:**
- **Zika Virus:** Transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, Zika virus gained global attention during the 2015-2016 outbreak in the Americas, linked to severe birth defects such as microcephaly.
- **Dengue Fever:** Another mosquito-borne disease, dengue is caused by the dengue virus and has seen a resurgence in tropical and subtropical regions.
- **Chikungunya:** Also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, chikungunya causes fever and severe joint pain, and has re-emerged in several regions over the past two decades.

**Key Drivers:**
- **Climate Change:** Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can expand the range of vectors, increasing the risk of disease transmission.
- **Urbanization:** Rapid urbanization, particularly in tropical regions, creates ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, leading to the spread of vector-borne diseases.

#### 2.3. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)

**Definition:**  
Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) evolve to resist the effects of drugs, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death.

**Examples:**
- **Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA):** A type of bacteria that is resistant to several widely used antibiotics, making infections difficult to treat.
- **Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB):** A form of tuberculosis that is resistant to at least two of the most potent first-line anti-TB drugs.
- **Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE):** A group of bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems, a class of last-resort antibiotics.

**Key Drivers:**
- **Overuse and Misuse of Antibiotics:** The widespread use of antibiotics in humans, animals, and agriculture accelerates the development of resistance.
- **Inadequate Infection Control:** Poor infection control practices in healthcare settings contribute to the spread of resistant infections.

### 3. Overview of Re-emerging Infectious Diseases
