## Chapter: Universal Health Coverage

### 1. Introduction

Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is a fundamental goal of health systems worldwide, aiming to ensure that all individuals have access to the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. Achieving UHC is central to improving health outcomes, reducing health disparities, and promoting social and economic development. This chapter explores the concept of UHC, its key components, the strategies for achieving it, and the challenges and opportunities associated with its implementation.

### 2. Understanding Universal Health Coverage

#### 2.1. Definition of Universal Health Coverage

Universal Health Coverage is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ensuring that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. UHC encompasses the full spectrum of essential health services, including health promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.

**Key Components of UHC:**

- **Equitable Access:** Ensuring that everyone, regardless of socio-economic status, geographic location, or other factors, has access to the necessary health services.
- **Quality of Care:** Providing health services that are of sufficient quality to improve the health of those receiving care.
