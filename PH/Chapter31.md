### 1. Introduction

Maternal health is a crucial aspect of public health, reflecting the overall health and well-being of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Maternal health indicators provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of healthcare systems, access to care, and the quality of maternal health services. This chapter explores the key global and national maternal health indicators, their significance, and the factors influencing these indicators. It also discusses the challenges in improving maternal health and strategies for enhancing maternal health outcomes.

### 2. Key Maternal Health Indicators

#### 2.1. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)

**Definition:**  
The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births within a given time period, usually a year. Maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.

**Significance:**  
The MMR is a critical indicator of the quality of maternal health services, access to healthcare, and the overall health status of women in a population. A high MMR often indicates poor access to skilled healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth, inadequate emergency obstetric care, and socio-economic barriers to maternal health services.

**Global Trends:**  
Globally, the MMR has declined by approximately 38% between 2000 and 2017, from 342 to 211 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. However, significant disparities remain between regions, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia accounting for the majority of maternal deaths.

**National Variations:**  
MMR varies widely between countries, with high-income countries generally reporting lower MMRs compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For example, in 2017, the MMR in sub-Saharan Africa was 542 per 100,000 live births, compared to 11 per 100,000 live births in high-income countries.

#### 2.2. Skilled Birth Attendance (SBA)

**Definition:**  
Skilled Birth Attendance (SBA) refers to the presence of a trained healthcare professional, such as a doctor, nurse, or midwife, during childbirth. SBA is a key intervention for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, as skilled attendants can manage complications and provide timely interventions.

**Significance:**  
The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is an essential indicator of access to quality maternal health services. Higher SBA rates are associated with better maternal and neonatal outcomes, including lower rates of maternal mortality, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths.

**Global Trends:**  
Globally, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel increased from 62% in 2000 to 81% in 2020. However, disparities remain, particularly in rural areas and among marginalized populations, where access to skilled care during childbirth is often limited.

**National Variations:**  
SBA rates vary significantly between countries and regions. In high-income countries, nearly all births are attended by skilled health personnel, whereas in some LMICs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, SBA rates remain below 60%.

#### 2.3. Antenatal Care Coverage (ANC)

**Definition:**  
Antenatal Care (ANC) coverage refers to the proportion of pregnant women who receive at least four antenatal care visits during their pregnancy. These visits are essential for monitoring the health of the mother and fetus, detecting and managing complications, and providing preventive care, including immunizations and nutritional supplements.

**Significance:**  
ANC coverage is an important indicator of access to maternal health services and the quality of care provided during pregnancy. Regular ANC visits are associated with improved maternal and neonatal health outcomes, including reduced risks of maternal mortality, preterm birth, and low birth weight.

**Global Trends:**  
Globally, ANC coverage has improved over the past two decades, with the proportion of women receiving at least four ANC visits increasing from 52% in 2000 to 64% in 2020. However, many women, particularly in LMICs, still do not receive the recommended number of ANC visits.

**National Variations:**  
ANC coverage varies widely between countries, with high-income countries generally achieving near-universal coverage, while LMICs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, continue to face challenges in ensuring adequate ANC coverage.

#### 2.4. Adolescent Birth Rate

**Definition:**  
The Adolescent Birth Rate is the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years in a given year. It is a key indicator of reproductive health, particularly among young women, and is associated with increased risks of maternal and neonatal complications.

**Significance:**  
High adolescent birth rates are often associated with higher risks of maternal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal mortality. Adolescent mothers are also more likely to experience social and economic challenges, including lower educational attainment and limited access to healthcare.

**Global Trends:**  
Globally, the adolescent birth rate has declined over the past two decades, from 56 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in 2000 to 43 births per 1,000 women in 2020. However, adolescent birth rates remain high in certain regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

**National Variations:**  
Adolescent birth rates vary significantly between countries and regions. In high-income countries, adolescent birth rates are generally low, while in some LMICs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, rates exceed 100 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19.

#### 2.5. Postnatal Care Coverage

**Definition:**  
Postnatal Care (PNC) coverage refers to the proportion of women who receive postnatal care within two days of childbirth. PNC is crucial for monitoring the health of the mother and newborn, detecting and managing complications, and providing essential interventions, such as breastfeeding support and immunizations.

**Significance:**  
PNC coverage is an important indicator of access to maternal and neonatal health services during the critical postpartum period. Adequate PNC can help prevent maternal and neonatal deaths, reduce the risk of postpartum complications, and promote healthy practices such as exclusive breastfeeding.

**Global Trends:**  
Globally, PNC coverage has improved over the past two decades, with the proportion of women receiving postnatal care within two days of childbirth increasing from 48% in 2000 to 66% in 2020. However, many women, particularly in LMICs, still do not receive timely postnatal care.

**National Variations:**  
PNC coverage varies widely between countries, with high-income countries generally achieving near-universal coverage, while LMICs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, continue to face challenges in ensuring adequate PNC coverage.
