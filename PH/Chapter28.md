This chapter explores the complex relationship between climate change and public health, examining the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on health, the populations most vulnerable to these impacts, and strategies for mitigating and adapting to the health risks posed by a changing climate.

### 2. Understanding Climate Change

#### 2.1. Causes of Climate Change

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions:**  
The primary driver of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, leading to global warming and changes in climate patterns. Major sources of GHG emissions include the burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural activities.

**Human Activities:**  
Human activities, particularly industrialization, deforestation, and the expansion of agriculture, have significantly increased the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere. Since the industrial revolution, the global average temperature has risen by approximately 1.2°C, with projections indicating further increases if current emission trends continue.

**Global Warming and Climate Change:**  
Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth’s average surface temperature due to human activities. Climate change encompasses broader changes in climate patterns, including variations in precipitation, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, and shifts in ecosystems and biodiversity.

#### 2.2. Key Indicators of Climate Change

**Rising Temperatures:**  
Global temperatures have been steadily increasing, with the past decade being the warmest on record. Rising temperatures contribute to more frequent and severe heatwaves, altering ecosystems, and impacting human health.

**Melting Polar Ice and Sea Level Rise:**  
The warming climate is causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, leading to rising sea levels. This not only threatens coastal communities with flooding but also contributes to the loss of habitats for wildlife and the disruption of global weather patterns.

**Changes in Precipitation Patterns:**  
Climate change is altering precipitation patterns, leading to more intense and erratic rainfall in some regions and prolonged droughts in others. These changes affect water availability, agricultural productivity, and the frequency of floods and droughts.

**Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events:**  
There is a growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, and wildfires, as a result of climate change. These events have immediate and long-term impacts on public health, infrastructure, and ecosystems.

### 3. Direct Health Impacts of Climate Change
