## Chapter: National Strategies for NCD Prevention and Control

### 1. Introduction

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases, are the leading cause of death globally. They represent a significant public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems are often ill-equipped to manage the rising burden. National strategies for NCD prevention and control are critical for addressing this growing challenge. These strategies involve comprehensive, multi-sectoral approaches that include policy development, public health interventions, and healthcare system strengthening. This chapter explores key elements of national strategies for NCD prevention and control, highlighting successful examples and best practices.

### 2. Framework for National NCD Strategies

#### 2.1. Understanding the NCD Burden

**Epidemiological Assessment:**  
The first step in developing a national NCD strategy is to understand the specific burden of NCDs within the country. This involves collecting and analyzing epidemiological data on the prevalence, incidence, mortality, and risk factors associated with NCDs. National health surveys, cancer registries, and hospital data are key sources of information that can inform strategy development.

**Identifying Priority Areas:**  
Based on the epidemiological assessment, countries can identify priority areas for intervention. This might include targeting the most prevalent NCDs, addressing significant risk factors such as tobacco use and unhealthy diets, or focusing on vulnerable populations that are disproportionately affected by NCDs.

#### 2.2. Setting Goals and Objectives

**SMART Objectives:**  
National NCD strategies should include specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives. These objectives guide the implementation of the strategy and provide a framework for monitoring and evaluation. Examples of SMART objectives include reducing the prevalence of smoking by 20% within five years or increasing the proportion of adults engaging in regular physical activity by 15% over the same period.

**Alignment with Global Targets:**  
National goals should align with global targets, such as those outlined in the World Health Organization’s Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020, which includes a target to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by 25% by 2025. Alignment with global targets ensures that national efforts contribute to broader international goals and facilitates global collaboration.

#### 2.3. Multi-Sectoral Approach

**Engaging Multiple Sectors:**  
NCD prevention and control require a multi-sectoral approach that involves collaboration between various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, finance, transportation, and urban planning. Each sector plays a role in addressing the risk factors and social determinants of NCDs. For example, the education sector can promote health literacy and physical activity in schools, while the agriculture sector can support the production and availability of healthy foods.

**Whole-of-Government and Whole-of-Society Approach:**  
A whole-of-government approach involves the coordinated efforts of all government ministries and agencies in addressing NCDs. Similarly, a whole-of-society approach engages civil society organizations, the private sector, and communities in the design, implementation, and monitoring of NCD strategies. This ensures that interventions are comprehensive, sustainable, and culturally appropriate.

### 3. Key Components of National NCD Strategies

#### 3.1. Policy and Regulatory Interventions

**Tobacco Control Policies:**  
Tobacco use is one of the leading risk factors for NCDs. Effective tobacco control policies include increasing tobacco taxes, implementing smoke-free environments, banning tobacco advertising and promotion, and providing cessation support services. Countries like Australia and Thailand have successfully implemented comprehensive tobacco control policies, leading to significant reductions in smoking rates and tobacco-related diseases.

**Nutrition and Diet Policies:**  
Policies aimed at improving nutrition and promoting healthy diets are critical for NCD prevention. These policies may include regulating the marketing of unhealthy foods to children, implementing front-of-pack labeling, reducing salt and sugar content in processed foods, and promoting the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The United Kingdom’s soft drinks industry levy (sugar tax) is an example of a successful policy aimed at reducing sugar consumption and addressing obesity.

**Physical Activity Promotion:**  
Encouraging physical activity through urban planning, transportation policies, and workplace interventions is essential for reducing the risk of NCDs. National strategies can include creating safe spaces for walking and cycling, promoting active transport, and implementing physical activity programs in schools and communities. Brazil’s Agita São Paulo program is an example of a successful initiative that increased physical activity levels among the population.

**Alcohol Control Policies:**  
Reducing the harmful use of alcohol is another important component of NCD prevention. Effective policies include increasing alcohol taxes, regulating alcohol marketing, setting minimum drinking age laws, and implementing drink-driving laws. South Africa’s restrictions on alcohol advertising and availability have been part of a broader strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm.

#### 3.2. Health System Strengthening

**Integration of NCD Services:**  
Integrating NCD prevention and management services into primary healthcare is critical for improving access to care and ensuring early detection and treatment. This includes training primary healthcare workers in NCD management, providing essential medicines and technologies, and establishing referral systems for specialized care. Sri Lanka’s integration of NCD services into its primary healthcare system has been a model of success, improving access to care and reducing NCD-related mortality.

**Access to Essential Medicines:**  
Ensuring access to affordable and effective medicines for NCD management is a key component of national strategies. This may involve negotiating lower prices for essential medicines, improving supply chain management, and ensuring that medicines are available at all levels of the healthcare system. The WHO’s Essential Medicines List provides guidance on the medicines that should be available to manage NCDs.

**Human Resources for Health:**  
Strengthening the health workforce is essential for effective NCD prevention and control. This includes training healthcare workers in NCD management, task-shifting to allow non-specialist providers to deliver NCD services, and addressing workforce shortages, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Ethiopia’s Health Extension Program, which trains community health workers to provide basic NCD services, is an example of a successful human resources strategy.

**Health Information Systems:**  
Robust health information systems are critical for monitoring the burden of NCDs, tracking progress towards targets, and informing policy decisions. National strategies should include the development and strengthening of health information systems, including electronic health records, disease registries, and surveillance systems. South Korea’s cancer registry system has been instrumental in tracking cancer trends and informing national cancer control policies.

#### 3.3. Public Health Interventions

**Health Promotion and Education:**  
Public health campaigns that raise awareness about NCD risk factors and promote healthy behaviors are central to national strategies. These campaigns can target specific populations, such as children, adolescents, and high-risk groups, and use a variety of media, including television, radio, social media, and community outreach. Mexico’s public health campaign against sugary drinks has been a key component of its strategy to address obesity and diabetes.

**Screening and Early Detection:**  
National strategies should prioritize the screening and early detection of NCDs, particularly for conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Screening programs can be implemented at the primary healthcare level and should be linked to appropriate treatment and follow-up care. India’s National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) includes screening initiatives that have improved early detection rates.

**Vaccination Programs:**  
Vaccination programs play a crucial role in preventing certain NCDs, such as cervical cancer, which is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). National strategies should include vaccination programs for HPV, hepatitis B, and other preventable conditions that can lead to NCDs. Rwanda’s national HPV vaccination program has achieved high coverage rates and is expected to significantly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer.

**Community-Based Interventions:**  
Community-based interventions involve working with local communities to promote healthy behaviors, improve access to care, and address the social determinants of health. These interventions can be particularly effective in reaching underserved populations and addressing health disparities. The Healthy Village Project in Tanzania, which promotes healthy behaviors and NCD prevention at the community level, is an example of a successful community-based intervention.

### 4. Monitoring and Evaluation

#### 4.1. Setting Indicators and Targets

**Core Indicators:**  
National strategies should include a set of core indicators to monitor progress towards NCD prevention and control goals. These indicators should cover a range of areas, including risk factor prevalence, disease incidence and mortality, health system capacity, and the impact of interventions. Examples of core indicators include the prevalence of smoking, the incidence of diabetes, and the proportion of the population receiving hypertension treatment.

**National and Sub-National Targets:**  
In addition to global targets, countries should establish national and sub-national targets that are tailored to their specific context and priorities. These targets provide a benchmark for measuring progress and can help guide the allocation of resources and efforts. For example, a country might set a national target to reduce the prevalence of obesity by 10% over five years, with sub-national targets for specific regions or population groups.

#### 4.2. Data Collection and Analysis

**Strengthening Data Systems:**  
Accurate and timely data collection is essential for monitoring progress and evaluating the impact of NCD strategies. National strategies should include efforts to strengthen data collection systems, including disease registries, health surveys, and electronic health records. Ensuring that data is disaggregated by age, gender, and other relevant factors is important for identifying disparities and targeting interventions.

**Using Data for Decision-Making:**  
Data collected through monitoring and evaluation should be used to inform policy decisions, adjust interventions, and allocate resources. Regular analysis of data can help identify trends, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and ensure that national strategies remain relevant and responsive to changing circumstances. For example, South Africa’s use of data from its Demographic and Health Survey has informed its NCD

 policy decisions and program adjustments.

#### 4.3. Reporting and Accountability

**National Reporting Mechanisms:**  
Countries should establish mechanisms for regular reporting on the progress of their NCD strategies. This may include annual reports to the Ministry of Health, briefings to policymakers, and public reports that provide transparency and accountability. Reporting mechanisms should be designed to ensure that all stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, are informed and engaged in the process.

**Global Reporting and Accountability:**  
National strategies should align with global reporting frameworks, such as the WHO Global Monitoring Framework on NCDs, which tracks progress towards the global NCD targets. Participation in global reporting mechanisms enhances accountability and allows countries to benchmark their progress against international standards. The United Nations’ High-Level Meetings on NCDs provide a platform for countries to report on their progress and share best practices.
