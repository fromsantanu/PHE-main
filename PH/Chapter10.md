- **Health Systems Strengthening:** The infrastructure and systems developed for smallpox eradication, including surveillance and vaccination logistics, were later adapted for other public health initiatives.

### 3. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)

#### 3.1. Background

Polio, a viral disease that can cause paralysis and death, was once a major public health threat worldwide. In 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched by WHO, Rotary International, the CDC, and UNICEF, with the goal of eradicating polio globally.

#### 3.2. Strategies Employed

- **Mass Immunization:** The GPEI focused on mass immunization campaigns, particularly in polio-endemic countries. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) was used for its ease of administration and ability to provide community-wide immunity.
  
- **National Immunization Days (NIDs):** NIDs were conducted in polio-endemic countries to immunize all children under the age of five, regardless of their previous immunization status.

- **Surveillance:** A robust surveillance system was established to detect and respond to cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a key indicator of polio.

- **Targeted Interventions:** The program implemented targeted interventions in high-risk areas, including house-to-house vaccination campaigns and "mop-up" operations in response to detected cases.

#### 3.3. Challenges Overcome

- **Geopolitical Barriers:** Polio eradication efforts were hindered by conflict, political instability, and inaccessibility in some regions. Negotiating ceasefires and securing safe access for vaccination teams were critical to reaching children in these areas.

- **Vaccine Hesitancy:** Misinformation and distrust of vaccines led to resistance in some communities, requiring intensive efforts to educate and engage local leaders and populations.

- **Operational Challenges:** Maintaining the cold chain, ensuring vaccine supply, and reaching remote or nomadic populations posed significant operational challenges.

#### 3.4. Outcomes and Impact

- **Dramatic Reduction in Cases:** Since the launch of GPEI, the number of polio cases has decreased by over 99%, with only a few countries remaining endemic as of the 2020s.

- **Near-Eradication:** Polio remains endemic in just a few countries, but the global effort has brought the world to the brink of eradication, with continued progress toward this goal.

- **Strengthened Health Systems:** The infrastructure and systems developed for polio eradication, including surveillance and immunization logistics, have been adapted for other health initiatives, such as measles vaccination campaigns and routine immunization programs.

### 4. The Control of Malaria in Zanzibar

#### 4.1. Background

Malaria has long been a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. In the early 2000s, malaria was a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Zanzibar, particularly among children under five and pregnant women. A comprehensive malaria control program was launched to reduce the burden of the disease.

#### 4.2. Strategies Employed

- **Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs):** The widespread distribution of ITNs was a cornerstone of the program. These nets protect individuals from mosquito bites while they sleep, significantly reducing the transmission of malaria.
  
- **Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS):** IRS involves spraying the interior walls of homes with insecticides to kill mosquitoes that come into contact with treated surfaces. This intervention was implemented in high-transmission areas.

- **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs):** RDTs were introduced to improve the diagnosis of malaria, enabling prompt and accurate treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), the recommended treatment for malaria.

- **Health Education:** Community education and engagement efforts were undertaken to increase the use of ITNs, improve understanding of malaria prevention, and encourage timely treatment-seeking behavior.

#### 4.3. Challenges Overcome

- **Insecticide Resistance:** The emergence of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes posed a significant challenge, requiring ongoing monitoring and adaptation of insecticide use strategies.
