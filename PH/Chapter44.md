## Chapter: International Health Regulations (IHR)

### 1. Introduction

The International Health Regulations (IHR) are a legally binding framework established by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats that have the potential to spread across borders. Originally adopted in 1969 and significantly revised in 2005, the IHR aim to strengthen global health security by enhancing national capacities for surveillance, response, and communication of public health risks. This chapter explores the history and development of the IHR, their key components and principles, the obligations and responsibilities of member states, and the challenges and opportunities in implementing the IHR to enhance global health security.

### 2. History and Development of the International Health Regulations

#### 2.1. Origins of the IHR

**Early International Health Cooperation:**  
The origins of the IHR can be traced back to the 19th century when cholera outbreaks ravaged Europe and triggered a need for international cooperation to control the spread of infectious diseases. The first International Sanitary Conference was held in Paris in 1851, which aimed to standardize quarantine measures and establish a cooperative approach to disease control among countries.

**Adoption of the IHR (1969):**  
The initial version of the IHR was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969 to help monitor and control six serious infectious diseases: cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, relapsing fever, and typhus. These regulations were designed to prevent the international spread of these diseases while minimizing disruptions to international travel and trade.

#### 2.2. Revision and Expansion of the IHR (2005)

**Motivation for Revision:**  
Over time, the original IHR became outdated and inadequate for addressing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and other health threats. The 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) underscored the need for a comprehensive, modernized framework that could address new challenges, including rapid global travel, increased international trade, and emerging pathogens.

**Adoption of IHR (2005):**  
In response to these evolving challenges, the revised IHR (2005) were adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2005 and entered into force on June 15, 2007. The revised IHR expanded the scope beyond specific diseases to include all public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), introduced new legal obligations for member states, and established a framework for international cooperation and coordination.

### 3. Key Components and Principles of the IHR (2005)

#### 3.1. Scope and Objectives

**Broad Scope:**  
The IHR (2005) apply to any public health event that could potentially constitute a PHEIC, including infectious diseases, chemical and radiological incidents, and other hazards. The regulations are designed to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of diseases.

**Objectives of the IHR:**  
The primary objectives of the IHR are to enhance national, regional, and global capacities for public health surveillance and response; to prevent the spread of diseases across borders; and to provide a coordinated international response to health threats while minimizing interference with international traffic and trade.

#### 3.2. Core Capacities

**Surveillance and Response Capacities:**  
Under the IHR, member states are required to develop and maintain core capacities for surveillance and response, including the ability to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health risks. These capacities include public health infrastructure, workforce, laboratory capabilities, risk communication, and emergency response planning.

**National Focal Points (NFPs):**  
Each member state is required to designate a National Focal Point (NFP) responsible for communicating with the WHO and coordinating the country's response to public health risks. NFPs play a crucial role in ensuring timely reporting of events and facilitating international cooperation and coordination.

#### 3.3. Notification and Reporting

**Event Notification Requirements:**  
Member states must notify the WHO within 24 hours of assessing events that may constitute a PHEIC. The decision to notify is based on a set of criteria outlined in the IHR, including the severity of the event, its unusual or unexpected nature, the potential for international spread, and the potential for travel and trade restrictions.

**Reporting Obligations:**  
Member states are required to provide the WHO with accurate and timely information regarding the public health risks, including case definitions, laboratory results, source and type of risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting the spread of the disease, and the measures taken in response.

**Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC):**  
A PHEIC is an extraordinary event determined to pose a public health risk through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response. The decision to declare a PHEIC is made by the WHO Director-General, based on information provided by the affected countries and recommendations from an expert committee.

#### 3.4. Public Health Measures and Response

**Risk Assessment and Response:**  
The IHR require member states to assess public health risks using available information and take appropriate measures to prevent or control the spread of diseases. Public health measures must be based on scientific principles, evidence-based, and proportionate to the risk.

**Travel and Trade Restrictions:**  
The IHR aim to minimize unnecessary interference with international travel and trade. Member states are encouraged to implement public health measures that do not unduly restrict international movement or trade. If travel or trade restrictions are implemented, member states must provide the WHO with the public health rationale and scientific evidence for such measures.

**International Collaboration and Assistance:**  
The IHR promote international collaboration and assistance, including sharing information, expertise, and resources to strengthen global health security. Member states are encouraged to support each other in building and maintaining core capacities and responding to public health emergencies.

### 4. Obligations and Responsibilities of Member States

Countries are encouraged to assess their capacities regularly and address any gaps through national action plans and international support.

**Monitoring and Evaluation:**  
Member states are required to monitor and evaluate their progress in developing and maintaining core capacities. The WHO provides tools and guidelines for countries to conduct self-assessments and joint external evaluations (JEEs) to assess their IHR implementation status and identify areas for improvement.

#### 4.2. Notification and Reporting of Public Health Events

**Timely Notification:**  
Timely notification of events that may constitute a PHEIC is a key obligation under the IHR. Member states must promptly notify the WHO of any events that could pose an international public health risk, enabling the WHO to assess the situation and coordinate a global response if necessary.

**Transparency and Cooperation:**  
Member states are expected to provide transparent and accurate information to the WHO and other countries regarding public health risks and measures taken. Transparency and cooperation are essential for building trust, preventing the spread of misinformation, and ensuring an effective international response to health threats.

#### 4.3. Implementing Public Health Measures

**Evidence-Based Measures:**  
Public health measures implemented by member states must be based on scientific evidence and proportionate to the risk. Member states are encouraged to implement measures that are the least restrictive to international travel and trade while effectively controlling the public health risk.

**Respecting Human Rights:**  
The IHR emphasize the importance of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms when implementing public health measures. Member states must ensure that measures are non-discriminatory, respectful of individual rights, and sensitive to the needs of vulnerable populations.

#### 4.4. International Cooperation and Support

**Collaboration with WHO and Other Countries:**  
Member states are encouraged to collaborate with the WHO and other countries in responding to public health emergencies, sharing information, expertise, and resources. International cooperation is essential for preventing the spread of diseases and ensuring a coordinated response to health threats.
