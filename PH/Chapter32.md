## Chapter: Strategies for Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality

### 1. Introduction

Reducing maternal and child mortality is a central goal of global public health efforts. Despite significant progress over the past few decades, maternal and child mortality rates remain unacceptably high in many parts of the world, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This chapter explores the strategies and interventions that have been proven effective in reducing maternal and child mortality. It also discusses the challenges in implementing these strategies and highlights successful case studies from various countries.

### 2. Understanding Maternal and Child Mortality

#### 2.1. Maternal Mortality

**Definition:**  
Maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of the termination of pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.

**Causes:**  
The leading causes of maternal mortality include severe bleeding (postpartum hemorrhage), infections (sepsis), high blood pressure during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia), complications from delivery, and unsafe abortions. Many of these deaths are preventable with timely access to quality healthcare.

#### 2.2. Child Mortality

**Definition:**  
Child mortality refers to the death of a child before their fifth birthday. Neonatal mortality, a subset of child mortality, refers to deaths that occur within the first 28 days of life.

**Causes:**  
The primary causes of child mortality include preterm birth complications, birth asphyxia, neonatal infections, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition. Like maternal deaths, many child deaths are preventable with appropriate interventions.

### 3. Key Strategies for Reducing Maternal Mortality

#### 3.1. Improving Access to Skilled Birth Attendance

**Skilled Birth Attendance (SBA):**  
Ensuring that every woman has access to skilled care during childbirth is one of the most effective strategies for reducing maternal mortality. Skilled health personnel, such as doctors, nurses, and midwives, are trained to manage normal deliveries and recognize and treat complications.
